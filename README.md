Car Sales Analysis Power BI Dashboard:

This project provides an interactive Power BI dashboard for analyzing car sales data. The dashboard offers insights into various factors affecting car sales.


It visualizes sales trends over time, examining factors such as the relationship between selling price and kilometers driven, the distribution of cars based on fuel type, and the impact of seller type (dealer vs. individual) and transmission (manual vs. automatic) on sales. Additionally, the dashboard explores how ownership history affects car prices and highlights top-selling car models.


The project leverages Power BIâ€™s powerful data visualization capabilities to present key metrics that assist in decision-making and market trend analysis for car dealerships, manufacturers, and buyers.
